My survey form project from the: <em>Responsive Web Design Certification</em> section offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## Note

This version of the project is slightly different compared to the one I submitted on freeCodeCamp. This version has slight changes made to the CSS to give the layout some more breathing room - specifically on larger screens.
